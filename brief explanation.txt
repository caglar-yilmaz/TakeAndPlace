A take and place algorithm consist of two processes, perfomed concurrently. 
Aim of the processes is generating randomly sized, within a grading curve,
and randomly placed aggregate structure. 

Aggregate is represented by aggregate object which inherits "shape". "Shape"
consists "Node" and "Edge". "Place" is responsible for generation of random 
place and the methods related with if the generated place is placeable. "Take" 
is responsible for generating a random size for an aggragate within specified grades.
Generation of the grading curve is obtained with "FullerCurve". Finally, execution 
of the whole process is done by "Execute" which allows us to obtain a list of Aggregate.
